# Overview 
These are just some chess notes.

There are a number of different themes that can be used for embedded boards, the options for which are listed below:

```{python eval=FALSE}
theme: blue, blue2, blue3, canvas, wood, wood2, wood3, maple, green, marble, brown, leather, grey, metal, olive, purple
```

There are also coloration themes:

```{python eval=FALSE}
bg: light, dark
```

Here is an example of what should be added after the html link of a study to style the board and start at initial position

```{python eval=FALSE}
?bg=dark&theme=metal#0
```
